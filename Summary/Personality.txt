Backstory: Born in the midst of the Cold War, in the far northern oblast of Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union, Alisa grew up in a relatively normal, middle-class Russian family. Living in a small town of a few thousand a couple miles from the city proper, she often went hunting with her father in the countryside, learning how to operate a rifle and even acquiring foraging skills that helped with survival in the harsh Russian Arctic. Alisa was responsible, hardworking and filial, always helping around the house with chores like cleaning and taking care of her grandmother. Church every Sunday. Doing well at the local school. In essence, she was the pride of her family, and she did her best to ensure her parents never had to worry about her, having a loving relationship with her family.
Despite her maturity however, Alisa was still a naive and sheltered girl. Having never gone far from home, she knew little about anything outside of her small community. Her world was her small village, and nothing more. As a result, Alisa was caught completely unaware as things began to change. Radio channels began turning to static. Traders and suppliers stopped coming. Whispers of some kind of "disease" and "monsters" reached her town from refugees. Then, people got sick.
Before she could piece it all together, all hell broke loose. Animals turned rabid, attacking random people. Then the humans did the same. An incurable, fatal sickness that changed those it touched into mutated creatures. As social order broke down, her father got sick too. When her mother refused to leave his side, Alisa steeled her resolve, realising what she had to do. Taking her father's rifle and knife, she fled her home, leaving everything behind in a desperate bid for survival.
Four years since that time, the Union is no more. Cities are now ruins, and most have fallen. All there was left now are the few survivors and the "afflicted". Doing anything to survive, Alisa held on, suffering through the worst of it all, burdened with both surviving alone in a apocalypse and the guilt of abandoning her loved ones to survive.
